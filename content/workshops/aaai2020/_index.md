## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. However, education, a crucial component of our society still remains a relatively under-explored domain. In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of the massive open online courses have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education. Although it is still in the early stage, promising results have been achieved in solving various critical problems in education. For example, knowledge tracing, which is a intrinsically difficult problem due to the complexity under human learning procedure, has been solved successfully with powerful deep neural networks that can fully take the advantages of massive student exercise data. Besides the achievement in improving the student learning efficiency, similar excitement has been generated in other areas of education. For instance, researchers have also devoted to reducing the monotonous and tedious grading workloads of teaching professionals by building automatic grading systems that are underpinned by effective models from natural language process fields. Despite aforementioned success, developing and applying AI technologies to education is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Therefore, it is timely and necessary to provide a venue, which can bring together academia researchers and education practitioners to (1) to discuss the principles, limitations and applications of AI for education; and (2) to foster research on innovative algorithms, novel techniques, and new applications to education.

> Bio: Kurt VanLehn is the Diane and Gary Tooker Chair for Effective Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math at Arizona State University. He is also a Professor of Computer Science. He received a Ph. D. from MIT in 1983 in Computer Science, and worked at BBN, Xerox PARC, CMU and the LRDC (University of Pittsburgh). He founded and co-directed two large NSF research centers (Circle; the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center). He has published over 185 peer-reviewed publications, is a fellow in the Cognitive Science Society, and is on the editorial boards of Cognition and Instruction and the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education. Dr. VanLehn has been working in the field of intelligent tutoring systems since such systems were first invented. Most of his current work seeks new applications of this well-established technology. Four current projects are: (1) FACT, a classroom orchestration system for helping middle school math teachers both deeply analyze student work and manage the flow of ideas and student work across individual, group and whole-class activities; (2) TopoMath, an intelligent tutoring system that teaches high school and developmental math students how to solve algebra word/modeling problems by displaying their structural topology; (3) Dragoon, an intelligent tutoring system that imparts skill in constructing models of dynamic systems so rapidly that it has been used in high school science classes, university sustainability classes and Navy electronics classes to help students understand the systems more deeply; and (4) SEATR, a general-purpose adaptive task selection service that is currently being used in an intelligent tutoring system for organic chemistry.

> 
> Abstract: With the recent development of AI, there has been tremendous changes in both offline and online education. Entire in-class interactions and behaviors between students and instructors have been structured and stored, which provide valuable information for analyzing class performance and improving the learning experience. In this talk, I will first show some successful applications we deployed in TAL's offline and online classrooms. Then I will outline the challenges we meet during the course of building real-world AI+Edu applications. After that, I will talk about the three initiatives we developed on (1) building a quality-assured online learning platform, which is able to utilize multimodal information from the online environment to conduct pedagogical monitoring and alerting; (2) studying a cost-effective and consistent approach of verbal fluency evaluation, which help elementary students improve their oral language skills after school; and (3) getting inside the black box of classroom by neural multimodal learning, which helps teachers get instant feedback on their pedagogical instructions.
